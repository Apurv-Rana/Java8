This project basically contains the implementation of Serialization and Deserialization in java.
Here employee.txt is the serialized file.
What we can learn from this project is that we can't serialize static and transient data members and if we modify the serialized file and make some changes we can never deserialize it.
>Serialization is a mechanism of converting the state of an object into a byte stream.
>Deserialization, on the other hand, is the reverse process where the byte stream is used to recreate the actual Java object in memory.

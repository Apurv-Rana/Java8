2) Write a program that accepts two command line parameters: a file path and a string. The code should print the number of occurrence of the specified string in the given file.

3) Write an interactive program that saves all the lines the user writes into a given file. The name of the output file must be specified during the startup.

4) Write a program that prints the first N lines of the specified file. Make N=5 by default if the command line argument is unspecified.

5) Write a program that prints the last N lines of the specified file. Make N=5 by default if the command line argument is unspecified.

6) Write a program that has three command line arguments: two input files and an output file.  The program should merge the two input files into the given output file. If the output file exists, it should ask the user for confirmation.

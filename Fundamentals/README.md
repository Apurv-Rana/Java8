> The project Contents the tasks given to do hands on practice on clean code, by creating the following programs using standard clean code practices.

Task 1: FIZZ-BUZZ TEST
	This program prints the numbers from 1 to 100.If the number can be divided bt three, print "Fizz", If the number can be divided by five, print "Buzz" instead
	of the number, If both condition holds, print "FizzBuzz" , instead of the number.
	
	Sample OutPut : 1 2 Fizz 4 Buzz ..... 13 14 FizzBuzz...

Task 2: Collatz-Sequence
	This program prints the Collatz-Sequence starting from A_0=N (N<100 is a command line argument and it must be checked) until A_n=1. The sequence is generated in a way
	if A_(n-1) is even 1/2(A_(n-1)), and if A_(n-1) is odd 3*A_(n-1)+1.

	Sample Output : java Collatz 3
			3 10 5 16 8 4 2 1

Task 3: C2F
	This program Accepts 2 Command line Arguments, If the first Parameter is 0, then convert Second perameter form celsius to fahrenheit. Otherwise Convert the second 
	perameter form fahrenheit to celsius.

Task 4: Perfect Number
	This program tell the given number is perfect number or not. A perfect number is a number that is equal to the sum of its proper Divisor like 6, 28, 496.
